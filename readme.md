# Flex Utils

A set of CSS utility classes that make usually tedious and frustrating tasks in CSS (e.g. vertical centering) easy, using Flexbox. Inspired by the [What the Flexbox?!][1] video series by [Wes Bos][2], and the [Solved by Flexbox][3] tutorials.

I'm no CSS Flexbox expert, but I do fight CSS occasionally, so all contributions and requests are welcome!
